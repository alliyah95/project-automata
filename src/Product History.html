			<p id="issue"> Whether people like it or not, the use of computers cannot be dismissed, from students doing school works such as essays, researches, videos, PowerPoint presentations, and the likes, down to teachers using it for recording and computing grades, doing lesson plans, and creating presentations for discussions. Having a slow computer can be annoying and ineffective for people which, more often than not, leads to stress resulting in unproductivity. The unresponsiveness of a computer may lead to lack of efficiency which results in being unproductive as well.</p>

			<p id="issue2"> Furthermore, if people want to solve the problem of their computers, going to repair shops can be a hassle considering the time it takes to travel, counting on the route and traffic, and the cost of fuel wherein instead of using the time to do work, it is being wasted on shops. <b>The digital productivity of humans can be negatively impacted by this issue.</b></p>

			<h1 id ="baby"><i> Baby Steps.</i> </h1>
			<p id="steps"> In order to avoid going through such trouble, the team came up with a solution by optimizing a computer without having to store files in an external hard drive or uploading files online. This can be achieved through the use of scripting languages. Scripting languages use scripts that have varying purposes. One of these tasks is tuning up computers. Scripts may be automated so that the computer will perform tasks without having to delve down the computer. </p>
			<p id="steps2"> An idea arose and called it <b><i>Project Automata</i></b>. The plan for Project Automata involved three main modules which would be the Cleanup, Protection, and Restoration modules or CPR for short. These were expected to boost the performance of the computers by at least 50%. </p>

			<h1 id ="project"> <i>Project Automata.</i> </h1>
			<p id="automata"> Project Automata was designed to improve the overall performance of slow computers of the grade 12 STEM students of HAU who have little to no experience on proper computer maintenance. The program aims to do its purpose with the least amount of user input possible in order to not disrupt their workflow, letting them do their work while the program runs in the background.</p>
